In my Advanced Quantitative Methods for Policy Analysis class (fall 2017), I examined the relationship between the 
food pyramid's introduction in 1992 and changes in food sales. UChicago hosts Dominick's Data, which contains
several thousands data points on sales from Dominick's grocery stores around Chicago between 1989 and 1997. I used these data
to answer the question of whether there is any change in sales caused by the food pyramid. If there was a change, it was
negligible.
